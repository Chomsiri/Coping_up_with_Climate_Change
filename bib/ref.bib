	abstract = {Being an archipelagic nation, the Philippines is susceptible and vulnerable to the ill-effects of weather-related hazards. Extreme weather events, which include tropical cyclones, monsoon rains and dry spells, have triggered hazards (such as floods and landslides) that have turned into disasters. Financial resources that were meant for development and social services have had to be diverted in response, addressing the destruction caused by calamities that beset different regions of the country. Changing climatic patterns and weather-related occurrences over the past five years (2004–08) may serve as an indicator of what climate change will mean for the country. Early recognition of this possibility and the implementation of appropriate action and measures, through disaster risk management, are important if loss of life and property is to be minimised, if not totally eradicated. This is a matter of urgent concern given the geographical location and geological characteristics of the Philippines.},

	abstract = {There have been many previous studies of technical inefﬁciency in rice production in the Philippines, but none has focused simultaneously on production risk and technical inefﬁciency at the farm level. Rice production is inherently risky because of the heterogeneous production environment. In this study, we analyze technical inefﬁciency in a rainfed lowland rice environment in Central Luzon using a stochastic frontier production function with a heteroskedastic error structure. An 8-year panel dataset collected from 46 rainfed rice farmers was used to estimate ﬂexible functional speciﬁcations. Over the whole period, the average technical efﬁciency was found to be 79 percent. Results indicate that there is a high degree of variability in technical efﬁciency estimates, which can be attributed to the instability of farming conditions in the rainfed lowland environment. Mean output was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by area planted to rice, labor and the amount of fertilizer used. Consequently, these inputs were found to be risk-increasing, whereas herbicide was found to be a risk-reducing input.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the perfonnance of the rice sector over the last three decades. The rice sector accounts for 30\% of Philippine agriculture's gross value added. It is the single most important source of livelihood among small farmers and landless agricultural workers who also comprise 40\% ofthe t9tallabor force . Rice production and importation fluctuated in the past forty years. The productive years) 977 and 1983, during which the country was even able to export rice at some point, were short lived. During most of the ensuing years, given the low growth of productivity and rapidly growing population, consumption increasingly outpaced production. Imports rose with population growth, especially in the second half of the 1990s when the country was also beset by the EI Nino phenomenon. With the country's joining the WTO, Congress passed Republic Act 8178 which lifted all quantitative import restrictions in agriculture except rice. While the overall tariffprotection for agriculture is {\textbackslash}3.3\%, the tariffequivalent of the present QR ofrice from 1995-2002 is 67.2\%. The exemption oftariffication of rice QRs is due to expire in 2004. The rice and agriculture problem was analyzed using the Agricultural Policy Simulation Model, a multi-market simulation model of Philippine agriculture with two scenarios: a business-as-usual agenda and a strong refonn agenda. The business-as-usual simulation results suggested that yield growth rates in the medium term are low by historical and international standards and poverty reduction is low. On the other hand, the strong reform agenda scenario suggested reduced domestic agricultural prices arising from the reduction in tariffs and removal of QRs. Furthennore, the impact on poverty is high in the medium tenn, poverty incidence is lower by 10 percentage points.},
